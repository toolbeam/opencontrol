import Diagram from "../../../assets/diagram.svg";

OpenControl is a [Hono](https://honojs.dev/) server that is meant to be deployed within your infrastructure. This means that it gets access to both your **codebase** and **infrastructure** by default.

<Diagram />

It exposes a couple of endpoints:

- **`/`**

  This serves the chat client for OpenControl.

- **`/auth`**

  This serves an authentication endpoint that the chat client will use.

- **`/mcp`**

  This endpoint returns the tools that you are exposing to the chat client. Tool is just some code that can be executed by the chat client.

  Since OpenControl lives in your codebase, a tool can just execute any code in your codebase, or talk to your database, or AWS account. Or anything your code has access to.

- **`/generate`**

  This endpoint calls the models with the messages from the chat client and the list of tools. The models might respond with a message asking to execute a given tool.

  The client does this by running the `/mcp` endpoint and returning the response back to the models. It conitnues to do run this loop till the model is done.
