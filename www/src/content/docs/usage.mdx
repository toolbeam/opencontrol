Once [deployed](/docs/), OpenControl can be accessed through the built-in chat client and or your MCP client of choice.

---

## Default client

By default, OpenControl deploys a chat client at the `/` endpoint.

<Image src={screenshot} alt="OpenControl chat client" />

If you've deployed it with SST, the [`OpenControl`](https://sst.dev/docs/component/aws/opencontrol/) component generates a password you can use. You can print this out on deploy.

```ts title="sst.config.ts"
return {
  OpenControlUrl: server.url,
  OpenControlPassword: server.password
}
```

Now if you navigate to the URL, you can log in with the password and talk to your tools.

## MCP clients

You can also use OpenControl with any MCP client.

### Claude Code

To connect [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview) to your OpenControl server:

```bash
claude mcp add MyOpenControl npx opencontrol https://<opencontrol-url> <key>
```

Replace `<opencontrol-url>` with your OpenControl server URL and `<key>` with the password. And _"MyOpenControl"_ is whatever you want to name it in Claude Code.
